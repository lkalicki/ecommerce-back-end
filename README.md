## Description 

The E-Commerce Back-End application is designed to leverage Express.js to create an API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. Ultimately, it creates a development databased with seeded test data. Through the use of Insomnia, each of the api POST, PUT, and DELETE routes is functional and displays in a formatted JSON. 

## Installation

In order to install the E-Commerce Back-End application, the user must run 'npm install express sequelize mysql2' as well as 'npm install dotenv', to ensure the proper Node.js packages are installed. Then, once the code is downloaded, it can be executed via 'node server'. Insomnia should also be downloaded so that the API routes can be tested. 

## Usage 

To run the application, enter 'node server.js' in the command prompt and select the desired actions.
